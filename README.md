# Description of the project

For this assignment I plan to create an interactive audio visualiser where the viewer explores an infinte universe that is generated by the audio being played.

Visual elements:
- Volume: Different astral objects will be generated depending on the volume of the audio being played(this will depend on the volume of the audio itself not on the volume at  which the user plays it)
- Frequency: The amount of objects generated will depend on the frequency of the audio being played
- Object size and colour will change depending on the audio being played

Interactive elements:
- Moveable camera: Camera will rotate 360 degrees allowing the player to look around
- Audio selector: Menu where users will be able to pick the audio playing
- Visual menu: Menu where users can adjust visual settings
